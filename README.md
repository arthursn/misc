# Code Playground

A collection of various scripts, simulations, and data analysis projects I've worked on.

## Structure

- **mathematics**: Number theory, fractals, optimization, statistics
- **simulations**: Physical simulations, cellular automata, and other dynamic systems
- **data_analysis**: Data processing and visualization tools
- **data_scraping**: Web scrapers for various data sources
- **games**: Simple game implementations
- **utils**: Utility scripts for file conversion, git operations, and visualization

## Usage

Most scripts can be run directly with Python:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Notebooks can be opened with Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebook_name.ipynb
```
